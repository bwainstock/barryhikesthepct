<p>Today was intense and ended much better than it started. After 17 miles of crazy stormy hiking, we were holed up in a trailhead bathroom with another hiker named Kenny. It was 4:30 in the afternoon and our plan was to sleep in the 10 sqft bathroom. The storm wasn't letting up anytime soon and it was going to be a long night.

Around 5:30 a man named Paint Your Wagon appeared and offered us a ride to Lake Morena. He was just driving by and figured he'd check and see if anyone was hiding in the bathroom. We told him we were headed the other way and he bid us good luck. Before driving away, Paint Your Wagon poked his head back in and tossed us a bag of homemade muffins. His positivity was really awesome as more and more water was starting to leak into our temporary home.</p>
<p>By 6:30, the floor was pretty much completely wet and we were all a bit nervous about the next twelve hours. Just as we were going over midnight toilet etiquette, Keith from the Laguna Mountain Store showed up. He was also just driving by and figured he'd check in. Apparently this was a well known hideaway.</p>
<p>Unlike Paint Your Wagon, Keith offered us a ride to Julian, a small town up the road with a lodge. With a knowing look at each other, Matt and I took him up on his offer. Between the unrelenting weather, the unsanitary bathroom, and our growing aches, a warm dry room sounded great.</p>
<p>We said goodbye to Kenny and quickly hopped in Keith's truck. We pulled into town and he dropped us off in front of a cafe. We thanked him profusely and ducked in for some soup and tea. A quick phone call to the Julian Lodge and we booked ourselves a small room. We felt that we could justify this after the day we'd had.</p>
<p>The morning started as we filled our emptied bags back to capacity and made our way out of Mt. Laguna by 8:30. The mist that rolled in last night had stuck around which made for a chilly start. Amazingly, this was the calm before the storm.

The trail very slowly descended 1000 feet over the 17 miles we hiked while overooking the floor of the Colorado Desert. Or so we've seen in pictures. Over the 17 miles, the morning mist turned into whipping rain and 40 mph gusting wind. At the best times, we could see 150 feet in front of us. At the worst, five.</p>
<p>Our first stop of the day was at a trailhead six miles out to fill our water bottles. We saw two hikers who we had met in town, Comet and Not A Bear. People tend to go by fun names out here. We didn't stick around long as the temperature was dropping and we needed to warm back up. </p>
<p>Most of our hike today was a trudge and there wasn't much to look at. Every so often, the silhouette of a mountain or a boulder would appear and just as quickly vanish. We could hear voices in the distance, but we couldn't be sure it wasn't just the wind howling.

At our second water stop around noon we learned that the voices belonged to a group of hikers who met on the Appalachian Trail last year. Karate Kid, Forest, Sass, and Popeye joined us for lunch and we traded weather complaints.

We filled our water from a water cache here. Amazing people referred to as trail angels bring gallon jugs of water to parts of the trail that might not have other sources. Sometimes they are former hikers and sometimes they're just caring communities members.</p>
<p>Four hours of extreme marching later and we ran into Kenny. If you've read this far, you know the rest. We are so grateful for the support and encouragement from complete strangers. Tomorrow is unplanned in case the storm keeps going. We'll have to wait and see.</p>
