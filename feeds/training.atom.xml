        A gorgeous day at Henry Coe State Park
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like a long time since the local parks have allowed campfires because of the majorly dry conditions we've had, but those times are over for now.  Henry Coe State Park lifted their fire restrictions a few weeks ago which meant it was smores time!  To negate the campfire treats, we figured a hike was also in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forecast showed a high of 80Â° and clear skys so we loaded our packs full of water and set out for an 11 mile loop.  Last time we hiked this trail, it was the middle of summer and bone dry.  Thankfully, the bit of rain we've had left the creeks flowing and the swimming holes full.  It was a huge relief to see China Hole full and we knew we had to at least dip our feet in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.barryhikesthepct.com/castle-rock-state-park-training.html"&gt;pack rash&lt;/a&gt; that was bothering me last weekend was still acting up which gave me a chance to test out one of my blister/chafe prevention plans: &lt;strong&gt;leukotape&lt;/strong&gt;.  In the past, I've tried both duct tape and moleskin for this application, but I've found they both eventually fall off because of sweat.  Leukotape is a rayon based tape with an extremely strong adhesive often used for kinesio taping.  It's also breathable which is really useful for blisters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the hike on Saturday, a full game of soccer on Sunday, and a day of running errands on Monday, this stuff held up really well and could've gone longer.  I had to be very careful when peeling the tape off to not take skin with it.  I'm definately bringing a few yards of this with me on the trail and putting the rest of the roll in my bounce box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a chance to really test out my sun umbrella.  Believe it or not, it works just like any other umbrella would.  I really enjoyed being able to take my hat off and let my head breath while I was walking.  It was also great for blocking out the sun during our breaks.  I can see how this will come in handy, especially in the desert.&lt;/p&gt;

        Training hike at Castle Rock State Park
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was my last day at work which means it's time to start my &lt;strong&gt;official&lt;/strong&gt; training.  A friend and I headed up to my favorite hiking spot in the area at Castle Rock State Park.  Our goal was to hike 10 miles with our packs loaded while keeping our pace in mind.  We'd like to be comfortable hiking around 2.5 miles per hour on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wore my REI long sleeved sun shirt that I planned on wearing at the start of the trail.  Unfortunately, there are a couple seams that give me pretty bad pack rash so I'll have to start thinking about alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tree cover at Castle Rock gave me good chance to test my Spot GPS beacon.  If everything is working, the device should send out a message every 10 minutes.  It looks like it had trouble picking up signal in a few spots as there are a few markers missing from the map.  This wasn't too surprising as I'd seen this mentioned in reviews before.  I'm still happy with the amount that gets through, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also able to play with the special messages I can send from the Spot.  I have it setup to display a tent icon or a home icon which I plan to use when I'm at a camp site or in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to stretch our hike out longer than the established trail, we had to add a side route through a residential area.  We didn't realize just how residential it was so we cut our walk short and only made it through 8 miles.  Other than a few hiccups, it was a gorgeous day.&lt;/p&gt;
